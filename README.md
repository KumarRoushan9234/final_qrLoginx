# QR-based Check-In System

## üöÄ Overview

The **QR-based Check-In System** is a web and mobile application that allows users to check into locations or events using QR codes. It consists of three primary applications:

1. **Backend** - Manages authentication, QR code generation, and database storage.
2. **Partner App** - Enables partners to generate and manage QR codes for their locations.
3. **User App** - Allows users to scan QR codes, submit their details, and check in at locations.

The system leverages the **MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack for a complete full-stack solution with **JWT** for authentication and **QR code** generation and scanning capabilities.

### **Project Features**:

- **QR code generation** for partners to display at their locations.
- **QR code scanning** for users to check into events or locations.
- **JWT-based authentication** for secure login/signup.
- **Partner app** to manage location details and check-in approvals.
- **User app** for scanning QR codes and submitting check-in information.
